Bitsend Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Bitsend Core is the original Bitsend client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Bitsend transactions (which is currently more than 100 GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Bitsend Core, visit [bitsend.io](https://bitsend.io/en/releases/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Bitsend on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/bitsend-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/bitsendd` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run bitsend-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag Bitsend-Core to your applications folder, and then run Bitsend-Core.
